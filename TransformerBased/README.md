# JPEG-Inspired-DL

This repo is for reproducing the ImageNet experimental results in our paper [*JPEG Inspired Deep Learning*] submitted at ICLR 2025.

For CIFAR-100 and Fine-grained Tasks use [TransformerBased](https://github.com/JpegInspiredDl/JPEG-Inspired-DL/tree/main/TransformerBased) directory.

For ImageNet use [TransformerBased](https://github.com/JpegInspiredDl/JPEG-Inspired-DL/tree/main/ImageNet) directory.

## Acknowledgements

This repo is based on the code given in [RepDistiller](https://github.com/HobbitLong/RepDistiller) for CIFAR-100 and [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references/classification#resnet) for ImageNet. Also, we use [Transformer-based](https://github.com/OscarXZQ/weight-selection.git) to produce our results for Transformer-based models.
